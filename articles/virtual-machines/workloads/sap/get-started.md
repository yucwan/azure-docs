# Using Azure for hosting and running SAP workload scenarios

By choosing Microsoft Azure, you are able to reliably run your mission critical SAP workloads and scenarios on a scalable, compliant, and enterprise-proven platform.  Get the scalability, flexibility, and cost savings of Azure. With the expanded partnership between Microsoft and SAP, you can run SAP applications across dev/test and production scenarios in Azure - and be fully supported. From SAP NetWeaver to SAP S/4HANA, SAP BI, Linux to Windows, SAP HANA to SQL, we have you covered.

Besides hosting SAP NetWeaver scenarios with the different DBMS on Azure, you can host different other SAP workload scenarios, like SAP BI on Azure. 

The uniqueness of Azure for SAP HANA is an offer that sets Azure apart from competition. In order to enable hosting more memory and CPU resource demanding SAP scenarios involving SAP HANA, Azure offers the usage of customer dedicated bare-metal hardware for the purpose of running SAP HANA deployments that require up to 24 TB (120 TB scale-out) of memory for S/4HANA or other SAP HANA workload. This unique Azure solution of SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances) allows you to run SAP HANA on the dedicated bare-metal hardware with the SAP application layer or workload middle-ware layer hosted in native Azure Virtual Machines. This solution is documented in several documents in the section "SAP HANA on Azure (Large Instances)."   

Hosting SAP workload scenarios in Azure also can create requirements of Identity integration and Single-Sign-On using Azure Active Directory to different SAP components and SAP SaaS or PaaS offers. A list of such integration and Single-Sign-On scenarios with Azure Active Directory (AAD) and SAP entities is described and documented in the section "AAD SAP Identity Integration and Single-Sign-On."

## SAP HANA on Azure Virtual Machines
This section of the documentation covers different aspects of SAP HANA. As a prerequisite, you should be familiar with the principal services of Azure that provide elementary services of Azure IaaS, so mostly knowledge of Azure compute, storage, and networking. Many of those topics are handled in the SAP NetWeaver related [Azure Planning Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/planning-guide). 

The documentation specific for HANA on Azure consists of this list of articles and their subarticles:

- [Quickstart: Manual installation of single-instance SAP HANA on Azure VMs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/hana-get-started)
- [Deploy SAP S/4HANA or BW/4HANA on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/cal-s4h)

## SAP NetWeaver deployed on Azure Virtual Machines
In this section, you find planning and deployment documentation for SAP NetWeaver and Business One on Azure.
