# Guest operating systems supported on Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

## Windows

Azure Stack supports the Windows guest operating systems listed in the following table:

| Operating system | Description | Available in Marketplace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Server, version 1709 | 64-bit | Core with Containers |
| Windows Server 2016 | 64-bit |  Datacenter, Datacenter Core, Datacenter with Containers |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | 64-bit |  Datacenter |
| Windows Server 2012 | 64-bit |  Datacenter |
| Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 | 64-bit |  Datacenter |
| Windows Server 2008 SP2 | 64-bit |  Bring your own image |
| Windows 10 *(see note 1)* | 64-bit, Pro, and Enterprise | Bring your own image |

> [!NOTE]
> To deploy Windows 10 client operating systems on Azure Stack, you must have [Windows per User Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/product-licensing/windows10.aspx) or purchase through a Qualified Multitenant Hoster ([QMTH](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/CloudandHosting/licensing_sca.aspx)).

Marketplace images are available for Pay-as-you-use or BYOL (EA/SPLA) licensing. Use of both on a single Azure Stack instance isn't supported. During deployment, Azure Stack injects a suitable version of the guest agent into the image.

Datacenter editions are available in the marketplace for downloading; customers can bring their own server images including other editions. Windows client images are not available in the Marketplace.

## Linux

Linux distributions listed as available in the Marketplace include the necessary Windows Azure Linux Agent (WALA). If you bring your own image to Azure Stack, follow the guidelines in [Add Linux images to Azure Stack](azure-stack-linux.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Custom images should be built with the latest public WALA version (on 1903 azure stack build and above or with 1901/1902 hotfix) or with version 2.2.20. Versions before 2.2.20 and between 2.2.20 and 2.2.35 (exclusive) may not function properly on Azure Stack. 
>
> [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) is not supported on Azure Stack at this time.
