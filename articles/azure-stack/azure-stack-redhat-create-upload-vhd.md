# Prepare a Red Hat-based virtual machine for Azure Stack

In this article, you will learn how to prepare a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) virtual machine for use in Azure Stack. The versions of RHEL that are covered in this article are 7.1+. The hypervisors for preparation that are covered in this article are Hyper-V, kernel-based virtual machine (KVM), and VMware.

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux support information, refer to [Red Hat and Azure Stack: Frequently Asked Questions](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3413531).

## Prepare a Red Hat-based virtual machine from Hyper-V Manager

This section assumes that you already have an ISO file from the Red Hat website and installed the RHEL image to a virtual hard disk (VHD). For more information about how to use Hyper-V Manager to install an operating system image, see [Install the Hyper-V Role and Configure a Virtual Machine](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh846766.aspx).

### RHEL installation notes

* Azure Stack does not support the VHDX format. Azure supports only fixed VHD. You can use Hyper-V Manager to convert the disk to VHD format, or you can use the convert-vhd cmdlet. If you use VirtualBox, select **Fixed size** as opposed to the default dynamically allocated option when you create the disk.
* Azure Stack supports only generation 1 virtual machines. You can convert a generation 1 virtual machine from VHDX to the VHD file format and from dynamically expanding to a fixed-size disk. You can't change a virtual machine's generation. For more information, see [Should I create a generation 1 or 2 virtual machine in Hyper-V?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/compute/hyper-v/plan/should-i-create-a-generation-1-or-2-virtual-machine-in-hyper-v).
* The maximum size that's allowed for the VHD is 1,023 GB.
* When you install the Linux operating system, we recommend that you use standard partitions rather than Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which is often the default for many installations. This practice avoids LVM name conflicts with cloned virtual machines, particularly if you ever need to attach an operating system disk to another identical virtual machine for troubleshooting.
* Kernel support for mounting Universal Disk Format (UDF) file systems is required. At first boot, the UDF-formatted media that is attached to the guest passes the provisioning configuration to the Linux virtual machine. The Azure Linux Agent must mount the UDF file system to read its configuration and provision the virtual machine.
* Do not configure a swap partition on the operating system disk. The Linux Agent can be configured to create a swap file on the temporary resource disk. More information about can be found in the following steps.
* All VHDs on Azure must have a virtual size aligned to 1 MB. When converting from a raw disk to VHD, you must ensure that the raw disk size is a multiple of 1 MB before conversion. More details can be found in the steps below.
* Azure Stack does not support cloud-init. Your VM must be configured with a supported version of the Windows Azure Linux Agent (WALA).

### Prepare a RHEL 7 virtual machine from Hyper-V Manager

1. In Hyper-V Manager, select the virtual machine.

1. Click **Connect** to open a console window for the virtual machine.

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file, and add the following text:

    ```sh
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text as needed:

    ```sh
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    IPV6INIT=no
    NM_CONTROLLED=no
    ```

1. Ensure that the network service starts at boot time by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable network
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include additional kernel parameters for Azure. To do this modification, open `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and modify the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` parameter. For example:

    ```sh
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rootdelay=300 console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    ```

   This ensures that all console messages are sent to the first serial port, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. This configuration also turns off the new RHEL 7 naming conventions for NICs.

   Graphical and quiet boot are not useful in a cloud environment where we want all the logs to be sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if desired. Note that this parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the virtual machine by 128 MB or more, which might be problematic on smaller virtual machine sizes. We recommend that you remove the following parameters:

    ```sh
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```

1. After you are done editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```

1. Stop and Uninstall cloud-init:

    ```bash
    systemctl stop cloud-init
    yum remove cloud-init
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time, which is usually the default. Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following line:

    ```sh
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. The WALinuxAgent package, `WALinuxAgent-<version>`, has been pushed to the Red Hat extras repository. Enable the extras repository by running the following command:

    ```bash
    subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux Agent by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install WALinuxAgent
    sudo systemctl enable waagent.service
    ```

1. Do not create swap space on the operating system disk.

    The Azure Linux Agent can automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that is attached to the virtual machine after the virtual machine is provisioned on Azure. The local resource disk is a temporary disk, and it might be emptied when the virtual machine is deprovisioned. After you install the Azure Linux Agent in the previous step, modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

    ```sh
    ResourceDisk.Format=y
    ResourceDisk.Filesystem=ext4
    ResourceDisk.MountPoint=/mnt/resource
    ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y
    ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB=2048    #NOTE: set this to whatever you need it to be.
    ```

1. If you want to unregister the subscription, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. If you are using a system that was deployed using an Enterprise Certificate Authority, the RHEL virtual machine will not trust the Azure Stack root certificate. You need to place that into the trusted root store. See [Adding trusted root certificates to the server](https://manuals.gfi.com/en/kerio/connect/content/server-configuration/ssl-certificates/adding-trusted-root-certificates-to-the-server-1605.html).

1. Run the following commands to deprovision the virtual machine and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    ```bash
    sudo waagent -force -deprovision
    export HISTSIZE=0
    logout
    ```

1. Click **Action** > **Shut Down** in Hyper-V Manager.

1. Convert the VHD to a fixed size VHD using either the Hyper-V Manager "Edit disk" feature, or the Convert-VHD PowerShell command. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be uploaded to Azure.

## Prepare a Red Hat-based virtual machine from KVM

1. Download the KVM image of RHEL 7 from the Red Hat website. This procedure uses RHEL 7 as the example.

1. Set a root password.

    Generate an encrypted password, and copy the output of the command:

    ```bash
    openssl passwd -1 changeme
    ```

   Set a root password with guestfish:

    ```sh
    guestfish --rw -a <image-name>
    > <fs> run
    > <fs> list-filesystems
    > <fs> mount /dev/sda1 /
    > <fs> vi /etc/shadow
    > <fs> exit
    ```

   Change the second field of root user from "!!" to the encrypted password.

1. Create a virtual machine in KVM from the qcow2 image. Set the disk type to **qcow2**, and set the virtual network interface device model to **virtio**. Then, start the virtual machine, and sign in as root.

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file, and add the following text:

    ```sh
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text:

    ```sh
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    IPV6INIT=no
    NM_CONTROLLED=no
    ```

1. Ensure that the network service starts at boot time by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable network
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable installation of packages from the RHEL repository by running the following command:

    ```bash
    subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include additional kernel parameters for Azure. To do this configuration, open `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and modify  the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` parameter. For example:

    ```sh
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rootdelay=300 console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    ```

   This command also ensures that all console messages are sent to the first serial port, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. The command also turns off the new RHEL 7 naming conventions for NICs

   Graphical and quiet boot are not useful in a cloud environment where all the logs are sent to the serial port. You can leave the `crashkernel` option configured if desired. This parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the virtual machine by 128 MB or more, which might be problematic on smaller virtual machine sizes. We recommend that you remove the following parameters:

    ```sh
    rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
    ```

1. After you are done editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```bash
    grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```

1. Add Hyper-V modules into initramfs.

    Edit `/etc/dracut.conf` and add content:

    ```sh
    add_drivers+="hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc"
    ```

    Rebuild initramfs:

    ```bash
    dracut -f -v
    ```

1. Stop and Uninstall cloud-init:

    ```bash
    systemctl stop cloud-init
    yum remove cloud-init
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time:

    ```bash
    systemctl enable sshd
    ```

    Modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config to include the following lines:

    ```sh
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. When creating a custom vhd for Azure Stack, keep in mind that WALinuxAgent version between 2.2.20 and 2.2.35 (both exclusive) do not work on Azure Stack environments. You may use versions 2.2.20/2.2.35 versions to prepare your image. To use versions above 2.2.35 to prepare your custom image, update your Azure Stack to 1903 release or apply the 1901/1902 hotfix. 

     Follow these instructions to download the WALinuxAgent:
    
   a.	Download setuptools
    ```bash
    wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-7.0.tar.gz --no-check-certificate
    tar xzf setuptools-7.0.tar.gz
    cd setuptools-7.0
    ```
   b. This is an example where we download "2.2.20" version from the github repo. Download and unzip the 2.2.20 version of the agent from our github. 
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent/archive/v2.2.20.zip
    unzip v2.2.20.zip
    cd WALinuxAgent-2.2.20
    ```
    c. Install setup.py
    ```bash
    sudo python setup.py install
    ```
    d. Restart waagent
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart waagent
    ```
    e. Test if the agent version matches the one your downloaded. For this example, it should be 2.2.20.
    
    ```bash
    waagent -version
    ```

1. Do not create swap space on the operating system disk.

    The Azure Linux Agent can automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that is attached to the virtual machine after the virtual machine is provisioned on Azure. The local resource disk is a temporary disk, and it might be emptied when the virtual machine is deprovisioned. After you install the Azure Linux Agent in the previous step, modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

    ```sh
    ResourceDisk.Format=y
    ResourceDisk.Filesystem=ext4
    ResourceDisk.MountPoint=/mnt/resource
    ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y
    ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB=2048    #NOTE: set this to whatever you need it to be.
    ```

1. Unregister the subscription (if necessary) by running the following command:

    ```bash
    subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. If you are using a system that was deployed using an Enterprise Certificate Authority, the RHEL virtual machine will not trust the Azure Stack root certificate. You need to place that into the trusted root store. See [Adding trusted root certificates to the server](https://manuals.gfi.com/en/kerio/connect/content/server-configuration/ssl-certificates/adding-trusted-root-certificates-to-the-server-1605.html).

1. Run the following commands to deprovision the virtual machine and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    ```bash
    sudo waagent -force -deprovision
    export HISTSIZE=0
    logout
    ```

1. Shut down the virtual machine in KVM.

1. Convert the qcow2 image to the VHD format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > There is a known bug in qemu-img versions >=2.2.1 that results in an improperly formatted VHD. The issue has been fixed in QEMU 2.6. It is recommended to use either qemu-img 2.2.0 or lower, or update to 2.6 or higher. Reference: https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1490611.

    First convert the image to raw format:

    ```bash
    qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw rhel-7.4.qcow2 rhel-7.4.raw
    ```

    Make sure that the size of the raw image is aligned with 1 MB. Otherwise, round up the size to align with 1 MB:

    ```bash
    MB=$((1024*1024))
    size=$(qemu-img info -f raw --output json "rhel-7.4.raw" | \
    gawk 'match($0, /"virtual-size": ([0-9]+),/, val) {print val[1]}')
    rounded_size=$((($size/$MB + 1)*$MB))
    qemu-img resize rhel-7.4.raw $rounded_size
    ```

    Convert the raw disk to a fixed-sized VHD:

    ```bash
    qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed -O vpc rhel-7.4.raw rhel-7.4.vhd
    ```

    Or, with qemu version **2.6+** include the `force_size` option:

    ```bash
    qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed,force_size -O vpc rhel-7.4.raw rhel-7.4.vhd
    ```

## Prepare a Red Hat-based virtual machine from VMware

This section assumes that you have already installed a RHEL virtual machine in VMware. For details about how to install an operating system in VMware, see [VMware Guest Operating System Installation Guide](https://partnerweb.vmware.com/GOSIG/home.html).

* When you install the Linux operating system, we recommend that you use standard partitions rather than LVM, which is often the default for many installations. This avoids LVM name conflicts with cloned virtual machine, particularly if an operating system disk ever needs to be attached to another virtual machine for troubleshooting. LVM or RAID can be used on data disks if preferred.
* Do not configure a swap partition on the operating system disk. You can configure the Linux agent to create a swap file on the temporary resource disk. You can find more information about this in the steps that follow.
* When you create the virtual hard disk, select **Store virtual disk as a single file**.

### Prepare a RHEL 7 virtual machine from VMware

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network` file, and add the following text:

    ```sh
    NETWORKING=yes
    HOSTNAME=localhost.localdomain
    ```

1. Create or edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` file, and add the following text:

    ```sh
    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    TYPE=Ethernet
    USERCTL=no
    PEERDNS=yes
    IPV6INIT=no
    NM_CONTROLLED=no
    ```

1. Ensure that the network service will start at boot time by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo chkconfig network on
    ```

1. Register your Red Hat subscription to enable the installation of packages from the RHEL repository by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=XXX --password=XXX
    ```

1. Modify the kernel boot line in your grub configuration to include additional kernel parameters for Azure. To do this modification, open `/etc/default/grub` in a text editor, and modify the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` parameter. For example:

    ```sh
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rootdelay=300 console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 net.ifnames=0"
    ```

    This configuration also ensures that all console messages are sent to the first serial port, which can assist Azure support with debugging issues. It also turns off the new RHEL 7 naming conventions for NICs. In addition, we recommend that you remove the following parameters:

Note that this parameter reduces the amount of available memory in the virtual machine by 128 MB or more, which might be problematic on smaller virtual machine sizes.

1. After you are done editing `/etc/default/grub`, run the following command to rebuild the grub configuration:

    ```bash
    sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```

1. Add Hyper-V modules to initramfs.

    Edit `/etc/dracut.conf`, add content:

    ```sh
    add_drivers+="hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc"
    ```

    Rebuild initramfs:

    ```bash
    dracut -f -v
    ```

1. Stop and Uninstall cloud-init:

    ```bash
    systemctl stop cloud-init
    yum remove cloud-init
    ```

1. Ensure that the SSH server is installed and configured to start at boot time. This setting is usually the default. Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to include the following line:

    ```sh
    ClientAliveInterval 180
    ```

1. The WALinuxAgent package, `WALinuxAgent-<version>`, has been pushed to the Red Hat extras repository. Enable the extras repository by running the following command:

    ```bash
    subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    ```

1. Install the Azure Linux Agent by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install WALinuxAgent
    sudo systemctl enable waagent.service
    ```

1. Do not create swap space on the operating system disk.

    The Azure Linux Agent can automatically configure swap space by using the local resource disk that is attached to the virtual machine after the virtual machine is provisioned on Azure. Note that the local resource disk is a temporary disk, and it might be emptied when the virtual machine is deprovisioned. After you install the Azure Linux Agent in the previous step, modify the following parameters in `/etc/waagent.conf` appropriately:

    ```sh
    ResourceDisk.Format=y
    ResourceDisk.Filesystem=ext4
    ResourceDisk.MountPoint=/mnt/resource
    ResourceDisk.EnableSwap=y
    ResourceDisk.SwapSizeMB=2048    NOTE: set this to whatever you need it to be.
    ```

1. If you want to unregister the subscription, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo subscription-manager unregister
    ```

1. If you are using a system that was deployed using an Enterprise Certificate Authority, the RHEL virtual machine will not trust the Azure Stack root certificate. You need to place that into the trusted root store. See [Adding trusted root certificates to the server](https://manuals.gfi.com/en/kerio/connect/content/server-configuration/ssl-certificates/adding-trusted-root-certificates-to-the-server-1605.html).

1. Run the following commands to deprovision the virtual machine and prepare it for provisioning on Azure:

    ```bash
    sudo waagent -force -deprovision
    export HISTSIZE=0
    logout
    ```

1. Shut down the virtual machine, and convert the VMDK file to the VHD format.

    > [!NOTE]
    > There is a known bug in qemu-img versions >=2.2.1 that results in an improperly formatted VHD. The issue has been fixed in QEMU 2.6. It is recommended to use either qemu-img 2.2.0 or lower, or update to 2.6 or higher. Reference: <https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1490611>.

    First convert the image to raw format:

    ```bash
    qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw rhel-7.4.qcow2 rhel-7.4.raw
    ```

    Make sure that the size of the raw image is aligned with 1 MB. Otherwise, round up the size to align with 1 MB:

    ```bash
    MB=$((1024*1024))
    size=$(qemu-img info -f raw --output json "rhel-7.4.raw" | \
    gawk 'match($0, /"virtual-size": ([0-9]+),/, val) {print val[1]}')
    rounded_size=$((($size/$MB + 1)*$MB))
    qemu-img resize rhel-7.4.raw $rounded_size
    ```

    Convert the raw disk to a fixed-sized VHD:

    ```bash
    qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed -O vpc rhel-7.4.raw rhel-7.4.vhd
    ```

    Or, with qemu version **2.6+** include the `force_size` option:

    ```bash
    qemu-img convert -f raw -o subformat=fixed,force_size -O vpc rhel-7.4.raw rhel-7.4.vhd
    ```

## Prepare a Red Hat-based virtual machine from an ISO by using a kickstart file automatically

1. Create a kickstart file that includes the following content, and save the file. For details about kickstart installation, see the [Kickstart Installation Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/chap-kickstart-installations.html).

1. Place the kickstart file where the installation system can access it.

1. In Hyper-V Manager, create a new virtual machine. On the **Connect Virtual Hard Disk** page, select **Attach a virtual hard disk later**, and complete the New Virtual Machine Wizard.

1. Open the virtual machine settings:

    a. Attach a new virtual hard disk to the virtual machine. Make sure to select **VHD Format** and **Fixed Size**.

    b. Attach the installation ISO to the DVD drive.

    c. Set the BIOS to boot from CD.

1. Start the virtual machine. When the installation guide appears, press **Tab** to configure the boot options.

1. Enter `inst.ks=<the location of the kickstart file>` at the end of the boot options, and press **Enter**.

1. Wait for the installation to finish. When it's finished, the virtual machine is shut down automatically. Your Linux VHD is now ready to be uploaded to Azure.

## Known issues

### The Hyper-V driver could not be included in the initial RAM disk when using a non-Hyper-V hypervisor

In some cases, Linux installers might not include the drivers for Hyper-V in the initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs) unless Linux detects that it is running in a Hyper-V environment.

When you're using a different virtualization system (that is, Virtualbox, Xen, etc.) to prepare your Linux image, you might need to rebuild initrd to ensure that at least the hv_vmbus and hv_storvsc kernel modules are available on the initial RAM disk. This is a known issue at least on systems that are based on the upstream Red Hat distribution.

To resolve this issue, add Hyper-V modules to initramfs and rebuild it:

Edit `/etc/dracut.conf`, and add the following content:

```sh
add_drivers+="hv_vmbus hv_netvsc hv_storvsc"
```

Rebuild initramfs:

```bash
dracut -f -v
```

For more information, see [rebuilding initramfs](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1958).

## Next steps

You're now ready to use your Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual hard disk to create new virtual machines in Azure Stack. If this is the first time that you're uploading the VHD file to Azure Stack, see [Create and publish a Marketplace item](azure-stack-create-and-publish-marketplace-item.md).

For more information about the hypervisors that are certified to run Red Hat Enterprise Linux, see [the Red Hat website](https://access.redhat.com/certified-hypervisors).
