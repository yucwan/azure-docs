# Considerations for using virtual machines in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

Azure Stack virtual machines provide on-demand, scalable computing resources. Before you deploy virtual machines (VMs), you must understand the differences between the virtual machine features available in Azure Stack and Microsoft Azure. This article describes these differences and identifies key considerations for planning virtual machine deployments. To learn about high-level differences between Azure Stack and Azure, see the [Key considerations](azure-stack-considerations.md) article.

## Cheat sheet: Virtual machine differences

| Feature | Azure (global) | Azure Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Virtual machine images | The Azure Marketplace contains images that you can use to create a virtual machine. See the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/category/compute?subcategories=virtual-machine-images&page=1) page to view the list of images that are available in the Azure Marketplace. | By default, there aren’t any images available in the Azure Stack marketplace. The Azure Stack cloud administrator should publish or download images to the Azure Stack marketplace before users can use them. |
| Virtual machine sizes | Azure supports a wide variety of sizes for virtual machines. To learn about the available sizes and options, refer to the [Windows virtual machines sizes](../../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-sizes.md) and [Linux virtual machine sizes](../../virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md) topics. | Azure Stack supports a subset of Virtual Machine sizes that are available in Azure. To view the list of supported sizes, refer to the [virtual machine sizes](#virtual-machine-sizes) section of this article. |
| Virtual machine quotas | [Quota limits](../../azure-subscription-service-limits.md#service-specific-limits) are set by Microsoft | The Azure Stack cloud administrator must assign quotas before they offer virtual machines to their users. |
| Virtual machine extensions |Azure supports a wide variety of virtual machine extensions. To learn about the available extensions, refer to the [virtual machine extensions and features](../../virtual-machines/windows/extensions-features.md) article.| Azure Stack supports a subset of extensions that are available in Azure and each of the extension have specific versions. The Azure Stack cloud administrator can choose which extensions to be made available to for their users. To view the list of supported extensions, refer to the [virtual machine extensions](#virtual-machine-extensions) section of this article. |
| Virtual machine network | Public IP addresses assigned to tenant virtual machine are accessible over the Internet.<br><br><br>Azure Virtual Machines has a fixed DNS name | Public IP addresses assigned to a tenant virtual machine are accessible within the Azure Stack Development Kit environment only. A user must have access to the Azure Stack Development Kit via [RDP](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#connect-to-azure-stack-with-remote-desktop) or [VPN](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#connect-to-azure-stack-with-vpn) to connect to a virtual machine that is created in Azure Stack.<br><br>Virtual machines created within a specific Azure Stack instance have a DNS name based on the value that is configured by the cloud administrator. |
| Virtual machine storage | Supports [managed disks.](../../virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview.md) | Managed disks are supported in Azure Stack with version 1808 and later. |
| Virtual machine disks performance | Depends on disk type and size. | Depends on VM size of VM which the disks are attached to, refer to the [Virtual machine sizes supported in Azure Stack](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md) article.
| API versions | Azure always has the latest API versions for all the virtual machine features. | Azure Stack supports specific Azure services and specific API versions for these services. To view the list of supported API versions, refer to the [API versions](#api-versions) section of this article. |
| Azure Instance Metadata service | The Azure Instance Metadata Service provides information about running virtual machine instances that can be used to manage and configure your virtual machines.  | The Instance metadata service is not supported on Azure Stack. |
| Virtual machine availability sets|Multiple fault domains (2 or 3 per region)<br>Multiple update domains|Multiple fault domains (2 or 3 per region)<br>Multiple update domains (up to 20)|
| Virtual machine scale sets|Autoscale supported|Autoscale not supported.<br>Add more instances to a scale set using the portal, Resource Manager templates, or PowerShell. |
| Virtual machine diagnostics | Linux VM diagnostics | Linux VM diagnostics are not supported in Azure Stack. When you deploy a Linux VM with VM diagnostics enabled, the deployment fails. The deployment also fails if you enable the Linux VM basic metrics through diagnostic settings.

## Virtual machine sizes

Azure Stack imposes resource limits to avoid over consumption of resources (server local and service-level.) These limits improve the tenant experience by reducing the impact of resource consumption by other tenants.

- For networking egress from the VM, there are bandwidth caps in place. Caps in Azure Stack are the same as the caps in Azure.
- For storage resources, Azure Stack implements storage IOPS limits to avoid basic overconsumption of resources by tenants for storage access.
- For VMs with multiple attached data disks, the maximum throughput of each data disk is 500 IOPS for HDDs, and 2300 IOPS for SSDs.

The following table lists the VMs that are supported on Azure Stack along with their configuration:

| Type           | Size          | Range of supported sizes |
| ---------------| ------------- | ------------------------ |
|General purpose |Basic A        |[A0 - A4](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#basic-a)                   |
|General purpose |Standard A     |[A0 - A7](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#standard-a)              |
|General purpose |D-series       |[D1 - D4](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#d-series)              |
|General purpose |Dv2-series     |[D1_v2 - D5_v2](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#ds-series)        |
|General purpose |DS-series      |[DS1 - DS4](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#dv2-series)            |
|General purpose |DSv2-series    |[DS1_v2 - DS5_v2](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#dsv2-series)      |
|Memory optimized|D-series       |[D11 - D14](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#mo-d)            |
|Memory optimized|DS-series      |[DS11 - DS14](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#mo-ds)|
|Memory optimized|Dv2-series     |[D11_v2 - DS14_v2](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#mo-dv2)     |
|Memory optimized|DSv2-series -  |[DS11_v2 - DS14_v2](azure-stack-vm-sizes.md#mo-dsv2)    |

Virtual machine sizes and their associated resource quantities are consistent between Azure Stack and Azure. This includes the amount of memory, the number of cores, and the number/size of data disks that can be created. However, performance of VMs with the same size depends on the underlying characteristics of a particular Azure Stack environment.

## Virtual machine extensions

Azure Stack includes a small set of extensions. Updates and additional extensions are available through Marketplace syndication.

Use the following PowerShell script to get the list of virtual machine extensions that are available in your Azure Stack environment:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmVmImagePublisher -Location local | `
  Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImageType | `
  Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImage | `
  Select Type, Version | `
  Format-Table -Property * -AutoSize
```

If provisioning an extension on a VM deployment takes too long, let the provisioning timeout instead of trying to stop the process to deallocate or delete the VM.

## API versions

Virtual machine features in Azure Stack support the following API versions:

![VM resource types](media/azure-stack-vm-considerations/vm-resoource-types.png)

You can use the following PowerShell script to get the API versions for the virtual machine features that are available in your Azure Stack environment:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmResourceProvider | `
  Select ProviderNamespace -Expand ResourceTypes | `
  Select * -Expand ApiVersions | `
  Select ProviderNamespace, ResourceTypeName, @{Name="ApiVersion"; Expression={$_}} | `
  where-Object {$_.ProviderNamespace -like “Microsoft.compute”}
```

The list of supported resource types and API versions may vary if the cloud operator updates your Azure Stack environment to a newer version.

## Windows activation

Windows products must be used in accordance with Product Use Rights and Microsoft license terms. Azure Stack uses [Automatic VM Activation](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn303421(v%3dws.11)) (AVMA) to activate Windows Server virtual machines (VMs).

- Azure Stack host activates Windows with AVMA keys for Windows Server 2016. All VMs that run Windows Server 2012 R2 or later are automatically activated.
- VMs that run Windows Server 2012 or earlier are not automatically activated and must be activated by using [MAK activation](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff793438.aspx). To use MAK activation, you must provide your own product key.

Microsoft Azure uses KMS activation to activate Windows VMs. If you move a VM from Azure Stack to Azure and encounter activate problems, see [Troubleshoot Azure Windows virtual machine activation problems](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/troubleshoot-activation-problems). Additional information can be found at the [Troubleshooting Windows activation failures on Azure VMs](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mast/2017/06/14/troubleshooting-windows-activation-failures-on-azure-vms/) Azure Support Team Blog post.
