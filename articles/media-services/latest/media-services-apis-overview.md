# Developing with Media Services v3 APIs

This article discusses rules that apply to entities and APIs when developing with Media Services v3.

## Accessing the Azure Media Services API

To access the Azure Media Services resources, you should use the Azure Active Directory (AD) service principal authentication. The Azure Media Services API requires that the user or application that makes the REST API requests have access to the Azure Media Services account resource (typically either the **Contributor** or **Owner** role). For more information, see [Role-based access control for Media Services accounts](rbac-overview.md).

Instead of creating a service principal, consider using managed identities for Azure resources to access the Media Services API through Azure Resource Manager. To learn more about managed identities for Azure resources, see [What is managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

### Azure AD service principal 

If you are creating an Azure AD application and service principal, the application has to be in its own tenant. After you create the application, give the app **Contributor** or **Owner** role access to the Media Services account. 

If you are not sure whether you have permissions to create an Azure AD application, see [Required permissions](../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md#required-permissions).

In the following figure, the numbers represent the flow of the requests in chronological order:

![Middle-tier apps](../previous/media/media-services-use-aad-auth-to-access-ams-api/media-services-principal-service-aad-app1.png)

1. A middle-tier app requests an Azure AD access token that has the following parameters:  

   * Azure AD tenant endpoint.
   * Media Services resource URI.
   * Resource URI for REST Media Services.
   * Azure AD application values: the client ID and client secret.
   
   To get all the needed values, 
see [Access Azure Media Services API with the Azure CLI](access-api-cli-how-to.md)

2. The Azure AD access token is sent to the middle tier.
4. The middle tier sends request to the Azure Media REST API with the Azure AD token.
5. The middle tier gets back the data from Media Services.

## Naming conventions

Azure Media Services v3 resource names (for example, Assets, Jobs, Transforms) are subject to Azure Resource Manager naming constraints. In accordance with Azure Resource Manager, the resource names are always unique. Thus, you can use any unique identifier strings (for example, GUIDs) for your resource names. 

Media Services resource names cannot include: '<', '>', '%', '&', ':', '&#92;', '?', '/', '*', '+', '.', the single quote character, or any control characters. All other characters are allowed. The max length of a resource name is 260 characters. 

For more information about Azure Resource Manager naming, see: [Naming requirements](https://github.com/Azure/azure-resource-manager-rpc/blob/master/v1.0/resource-api-reference.md#arguments-for-crud-on-resource) and [Naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions).

## Long-running operations

The operations marked with `x-ms-long-running-operation` in the Azure Media Services [swagger files](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/specification/mediaservices/resource-manager/Microsoft.Media/stable/2018-07-01/streamingservice.json) are long running operations. 

For details about how to track asynchronous Azure operations, see [Async operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-async-operations#monitor-status-of-operation).

Media Services has the following long-running operations:

* Create LiveEvent
* Update LiveEvent
* Delete LiveEvent
* Start LiveEvent
* Stop LiveEvent
* Reset LiveEvent
* Create LiveOutput
* Delete LiveOutput
* Create StreamingEndpoint
* Update StreamingEndpoint
* Delete StreamingEndpoint
* Start StreamingEndpoint
* Stop StreamingEndpoint
* Scale StreamingEndpoint
