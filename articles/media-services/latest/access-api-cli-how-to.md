# Access Azure Media Services API with the Azure CLI
 
You should use the Azure AD service principal authentication to connect to the Azure Media Services API. Your application needs to request an Azure AD token that has the following parameters:

* Azure AD tenant endpoint
* Media Services resource URI
* Resource URI for REST Media Services
* Azure AD application values: the client ID and client secret

For more information, see [Developing with Media Services v3 APIs](media-services-apis-overview.md).

This article shows you how to use the Azure CLI to create an Azure AD application and service principal and get the values that are needed to access Azure Media Services resources.

## Prerequisites 

[Create a Media Services account](create-account-cli-how-to.md).

Make sure to remember the values that you used for the resource group name and Media Services account name.
