# Connect your Fortinet appliance 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

You can connect Azure Sentinel to any Fortinet appliance by saving the log files as Syslog CEF. The integration with Azure Sentinel enables you to easily run analytics and queries across the log file data from Fortinet. For more information on how Azure Sentinel ingests CEF data, see [Connect CEF appliances](connect-common-event-format.md).

> [!NOTE]
> - Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Step 1: Connect your Fortinet appliance using an agent

To connect your Fortinet appliance to Azure Sentinel, you need to deploy an agent on a dedicated machine (VM or on premises) to support the communication between the appliance and Azure Sentinel. You can deploy the agent automatically or manually. Automatic deployment is only available if your dedicated machine is a new VM you are creating in Azure. 

Alternatively, you can deploy the agent manually on an existing Azure VM, on a VM in another cloud, or on an on-premises machine.

To see a network diagram of both options, see [Connect data sources](connect-data-sources.md#agent-options).

### Deploy the agent in Azure

1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, click **Data connectors** and select your appliance type. 

1. Under **Linux Syslog agent configuration**:
   - Choose **Automatic deployment** if you want to create a new machine that is pre-installed with the Azure Sentinel agent, and includes all the configuration necessary, as described above. Select **Automatic deployment** and click **Automatic agent deployment**. This takes you to the purchase page for a dedicated VM that is automatically connected to your workspace, is . The VM is a **standard D2s v3 (2 vcpus, 8 GB memory)** and has a public IP address.
      1. In the **Custom deployment** page, provide your details and choose a username and a password and if you agree to the terms and conditions, purchase the VM.
      1. Configure your appliance to send logs using the settings listed in the connection page. For the Generic Common Event Format connector, use these settings:
         - Protocol = UDP
         - Port = 514
         - Facility = Local-4
         - Format = CEF
   - Choose **Manual deployment** if you want to use an existing VM as the dedicated Linux machine onto which the Azure Sentinel agent should be installed. 
      1. Under **Download and install the Syslog agent**, select **Azure Linux virtual machine**. 
      1. In the **Virtual machines** screen that opens, select the machine you want to use and click **Connect**.
      1. In the connector screen, under **Configure and forward Syslog**, set whether your Syslog daemon is **rsyslog.d** or **syslog-ng**. 
      1. Copy these commands and run them on your appliance:
          - If you selected rsyslog.d:
              
            1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'local4.debug  @127.0.0.1:25226' > /etc/rsyslog.d/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
            
            2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.
            
            1. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service rsyslog restart`
             
          - If you selected syslog-ng:

              1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'filter f_local4_oms { facility(local4); };\n  destination security_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_local4_oms); destination(security_oms); };' > /etc/syslog-ng/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
              2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.

              3. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service syslog-ng restart`
      2. Restart the Syslog agent using this command: `sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart [{workspace GUID}]`
      1. Confirm that there are no errors in the agent log by running this command: `tail /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/log/omsagent.log`

### Deploy the agent on an on premises Linux server

If you aren't using Azure, manually deploy the Azure Sentinel agent to run on a dedicated Linux server.


1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, click **Data connectors** and select your appliance type.
1. To create a dedicated Linux VM, under **Linux Syslog agent configuration** choose **Manual deployment**.
   1. Under **Download and install the Syslog agent**, select **Non-Azure Linux machine**. 
   1. In the **Direct agent** screen that opens, select **Agent for Linux** to download the agent or run this command to download it on your Linux machine:
        `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.shÂ && sh onboard_agent.sh -w {workspace GUID} -s gehIk/GvZHJmqlgewMsIcth8H6VqXLM9YXEpu0BymnZEJb6mEjZzCHhZgCx5jrMB1pVjRCMhn+XTQgDTU3DVtQ== -d opinsights.azure.com`
      1. In the connector screen, under **Configure and forward Syslog**, set whether your Syslog daemon is **rsyslog.d** or **syslog-ng**. 
      1. Copy these commands and run them on your appliance:
         - If you selected rsyslog:
           1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'local4.debug  @127.0.0.1:25226' > /etc/rsyslog.d/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
            
           2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.
           3. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service rsyslog restart`
         - If you selected syslog-ng:
            1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'filter f_local4_oms { facility(local4); };\n  destination security_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_local4_oms); destination(security_oms); };' > /etc/syslog-ng/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
            2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.
            3. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service syslog-ng restart`
      1. Restart the Syslog agent using this command: `sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart [{workspace GUID}]`
      1. Confirm that there are no errors in the agent log by running this command: `tail /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/log/omsagent.log`
 
## Step 2: Forward Fortinet logs to the Syslog agent

Configure Fortinet to forward Syslog messages in CEF format to your Azure workspace via the Syslog agent:

1. Open the CLI on your Fortinet appliance and run the following commands:

        config log syslogd setting
        set format cef
        set facility <facility_name>
        set port 514
        set reliable disable
        set server <ip_address_of_Receiver>
        set status enable
        end

    - Replace the server **ip address** with the IP address of the agent.
    - Set the **facility_name** to use the facility you configured in the agent. By default, the agent sets this to local4.
    - Set the **syslog port** to **514**, or the port set on the agent.
    - To enable CEF format in early FortiOS versions, you may need to run the command set **csv disable**.
 
   > [!NOTE] 
   > For more information, go to the [Fortinet Document Library](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-fortinet-fortinetdocumentlibrary). Choose your version and use the **Handbook** and **Log Message Reference**.

## Step 3: Validate connectivity

It may take upwards of 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics. 

1. Make sure that your logs are getting to the right port in the Syslog agent. Run this command the Syslog agent machine: `tcpdump -A -ni any  port 514 -vv` This command shows you the logs that streams from the device to the Syslog machine.Make sure that logs are being received from the source appliance on the right port and right facility.

2. Check that there is communication between the Syslog daemon and the agent. Run this command the Syslog agent machine: `tcpdump -A -ni any  port 25226 -vv` This command shows you the logs that streams from the device to the Syslog machine.Make sure that the logs are also being received on the agent.

1. If your Fortinet logs aren't being received by the agent, run this command, depending on which type of Syslog daemon you are using, to set the facility and set the logs to search for the word Fortinet in the logs:
   - rsyslog.d: `sudo bash -c "printf 'local4.debug Â @127.0.0.1:25226\n\n:msg, contains, \"Fortinet\" Â @127.0.0.1:25226' > /etc/rsyslog.d/security-config-omsagent.conf"`

     Restart the Syslog daemon: `sudo service rsyslog restart`
   - syslog-ng: `sudo bash -c "printf 'filter f_local4_oms { facility(local4); };\n Â destination security_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n Â log { source(src); filter(f_local4_oms); destination(security_oms); };\n\nfilter f_msg_oms { match(\"Fortinet\" value(\"MESSAGE\")); };\n Â destination security_msg_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n Â log { source(src); filter(f_msg_oms); destination(security_msg_oms); };' > /etc/syslog-ng/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
      
     Restart the Syslog daemon: `sudo service syslog-ng restart`
1. If both of those commands provided successful results, check Log Analytics to see if your logs are arriving. All events streamed from these appliances appear in raw form in Log Analytics under `CommonSecurityLog` type.
1. To check if there are errors or if the logs aren't arriving, look in `tail /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/log/omsagent.log`
1. Make sure that your Syslog message default size is limited to 2048 bytes (2KB). If logs are too long, update the security_events.conf using this command: `message_length_limit 4096`
6. To use the relevant schema in Log Analytics for the Fortinet events, search for **CommonSecurityLog**.
