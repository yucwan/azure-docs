# Connect your Check Point appliance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Sentinel is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

You can connect Azure Sentinel to any Check Point appliance by saving the log files as Syslog CEF. The integration with Azure Sentinel enables you to easily run analytics and queries across the log file data from Check Point. For more information on how Azure Sentinel ingests CEF data, see [Connect CEF appliances](connect-common-event-format.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Data will be stored in the geographic location of the workspace on which you are running Azure Sentinel.

## Step 1: Connect your Check Point appliance using an agent

To connect your Check Point appliance to Azure Sentinel, you need to deploy an agent on a dedicated machine (VM or on-prem) to support the communication between the appliance and Azure Sentinel. You can deploy the agent automatically or manually. Automatic deployment is only available if your dedicated machine is a new VM you are creating in Azure. 

Alternatively, you can deploy the agent manually on an existing Azure VM, on a VM in another cloud, or on an on-premises machine.

To see a network diagram of both options, see [Connect data sources](connect-data-sources.md).

### Deploy the agent in Azure

1. In the Azure Sentinel portal, click **Data connectors** and select your appliance type. 

1. Under **Linux Syslog agent configuration**:
   - Choose **Automatic deployment** if you want to create a new machine that is pre-installed with the Azure Sentinel agent, and includes all the configuration necessary, as described above. Select **Automatic deployment** and click **Automatic agent deployment**. This takes you to the purchase page for a dedicated VM that is automatically connected to your workspace. The VM is a **standard D2s v3 (2 vcpus, 8 GB memory)** and has a public IP address.
     1. In the **Custom deployment** page, provide your details and choose a username and a password and if you agree to the terms and conditions, purchase the VM.
      
        1. Run these commands on the Syslog agent machine to make sure that all Check Point logs will be mapped to the Azure Sentinel agent:
           - If you use Syslog-ng, run these commands (note that it restarts the Syslog agent):
            
                sudo bash -c "printf 'filter f_local4_oms { facility(local4); };\n  destination security_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_local4_oms); destination(security_oms); };\n\nfilter f_msg_oms { match(\"Check Point\" value(\"MESSAGE\")); };\n  destination security_msg_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_msg_oms); destination(security_msg_oms); };' > /etc/syslog-ng/security-config-omsagent.conf"

             Restart the Syslog daemon: `sudo service syslog-ng restart`
           - If you use rsyslog, run these commands (note that it restarts the Syslog agent):
                    
                 sudo bash -c "printf 'local4.debug  @127.0.0.1:25226\n\n:msg, contains, \"Check Point\"  @127.0.0.1:25226' > /etc/rsyslog.d/security-config-omsagent.conf"
             Restart the Syslog daemon: `sudo service rsyslog restart`

   - Choose **Manual deployment** if you want to use an existing VM as the dedicated Linux machine onto which the Azure Sentinel agent should be installed. 
      1. Under **Download and install the Syslog agent**, select **Azure Linux virtual machine**. 
      1. In the **Virtual machines** screen that opens, select the machine you want to use and click **Connect**.
      1. In the connector screen, under **Configure and forward Syslog**, set whether your Syslog daemon is **rsyslog.d** or **syslog-ng**. 
      1. Copy these commands and run them on your appliance:
          - If you selected rsyslog.d:
              
            1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to "Check Point", and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'local4.debug  @127.0.0.1:25226\n\n:msg, contains, \"Check Point\"  @127.0.0.1:25226' > /etc/rsyslog.d/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
            
            2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.
           
            1. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service rsyslog restart`
             
          - If you selected syslog-ng:

              1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to "Check Point", and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'filter f_local4_oms { facility(local4); };\n  destination security_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_local4_oms); destination(security_oms); };\n\nfilter f_msg_oms { match(\"Check Point\" value(\"MESSAGE\")); };\n  destination security_msg_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_msg_oms); destination(security_msg_oms); };' > /etc/syslog-ng/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
              2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.

              3. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service syslog-ng restart`
      2. Restart the Syslog agent using this command: `sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart [{workspace GUID}]`
      1. Confirm that there are no errors in the agent log by running this command: `tail /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/log/omsagent.log`

### Deploy the agent on an on premises Linux server

If you aren't using Azure, manually deploy the Azure Sentinel agent to run on a dedicated Linux server.

1. To create a dedicated Linux VM, under **Linux Syslog agent configuration** choose **Manual deployment**.
   1. Under **Download and install the Syslog agent**, select **Non-Azure Linux machine**. 
   1. In the **Direct agent** screen that opens, select **Agent for Linux** to download the agent or run this command to download it on your Linux machine:
        `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.shÂ && sh onboard_agent.sh -w {workspace GUID} -s gehIk/GvZHJmqlgewMsIcth8H6VqXLM9YXEpu0BymnZEJb6mEjZzCHhZgCx5jrMB1pVjRCMhn+XTQgDTU3DVtQ== -d opinsights.azure.com`
      1. In the connector screen, under **Configure and forward Syslog**, set whether your Syslog daemon is **rsyslog.d** or **syslog-ng**. 
      1. Copy these commands and run them on your appliance:
         - If you selected **rsyslog**:
           1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to "Check Point", and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'local4.debug  @127.0.0.1:25226\n\n:msg, contains, \"Check Point\"  @127.0.0.1:25226' > /etc/rsyslog.d/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
            
           2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.
           3. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service rsyslog restart`
         - If you selected **syslog-ng**:
            1. Tell the Syslog daemon to listen on facility local_4 and to "Check Point", and to send the Syslog messages to the Azure Sentinel agent using port 25226. `sudo bash -c "printf 'filter f_local4_oms { facility(local4); };\n  destination security_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_local4_oms); destination(security_oms); };\n\nfilter f_msg_oms { match(\"Check Point\" value(\"MESSAGE\")); };\n  destination security_msg_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_msg_oms); destination(security_msg_oms); };' > /etc/syslog-ng/security-config-omsagent.conf"`
            2. Download and install the [security_events config file](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-config-file-linux) that configures the Syslog agent to listen on port 25226. `sudo wget -O /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/{0}/conf/omsagent.d/security_events.conf "https://aka.ms/syslog-config-file-linux"` Where {0} should be replaced with your workspace GUID.
            3. Restart the syslog daemon `sudo service syslog-ng restart`
      1. Restart the Syslog agent using this command: `sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart [{workspace GUID}]`
      1. Confirm that there are no errors in the agent log by running this command: `tail /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/log/omsagent.log`
 
## Step 2: Forward Check Point logs to the Syslog agent

Configure your Check Point appliance to forward Syslog messages in CEF format to your Azure workspace via the Syslog agent.

1. Go to [Check Point Log Export](https://aka.ms/asi-syslog-checkpoint-forwarding).
2. Scroll down to **Basic Deployment** and follow the instructions to set up the connection, using the following guidelines:
   - Set the **Syslog port** to **514** or the port you set on the agent.
     - Replace the **name** and **target-server IP address** in the CLI with the Syslog agent name and IP address.
     - Set the format to **CEF**.
3. If you are using version R77.30 or R80.10, scroll up to **Installations** and follow the instructions to install a Log Exporter for your version.
 
## Step 3: Validate connectivity

It may take upwards of 20 minutes until your logs start to appear in Log Analytics. 

1. Make sure that your logs are getting to the right port in the Syslog agent. Run this command the Syslog agent machine: `tcpdump -A -ni any  port 514 -vv` This command shows you the logs that streams from the device to the Syslog machine.Make sure that logs are being received from the source appliance on the right port and right facility.
2. Check that there is communication between the Syslog daemon and the agent. Run this command the Syslog agent machine: `tcpdump -A -ni any  port 25226 -vv` This command shows you the logs that streams from the device to the Syslog machine.Make sure that the logs are also being received on the agent.
3. If both of those commands provided successful results, check Log Analytics to see if your logs are arriving. All events streamed from these appliances appear in raw form in Log Analytics under `CommonSecurityLog` type.

4. Make sure to run these commands:
  
   - If you use Syslog-ng, run these commands (note that it restarts the Syslog agent):

         sudo bash -c "printf 'filter f_local4_oms { facility(local4); };\n  destination security_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_local4_oms); destination(security_oms); };\n\nfilter f_msg_oms { match(\"Check Point\" value(\"MESSAGE\")); };\n  destination security_msg_oms { tcp(\"127.0.0.1\" port(25226)); };\n  log { source(src); filter(f_msg_oms); destination(security_msg_oms); };' > /etc/syslog-ng/security-config-omsagent.conf"
        Restart the Syslog daemon: `sudo service syslog-ng restart`

   - If you use rsyslog, run these commands (note that it restarts the Syslog agent): 

         sudo bash -c "printf 'local4.debug @127.0.0.1:25226\n\n:msg, contains, "Check Point" @127.0.0.1:25226' > /etc/rsyslog.d/security-config-omsagent.conf"
     Restart the Syslog daemon: `sudo service rsyslog restart`

1. To check if there are errors or if the logs aren't arriving, look in `tail /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspace id>/log/omsagent.log`
4. Make sure that your Syslog message default size is limited to 2048 bytes (2KB). If logs are too long, update the security_events.conf using this command: `message_length_limit 4096`
