# Set up Azure DevTest Labs infrastructure in your enterprise
Enterprises are rapidly adopting the cloud due to its [benefits](/architecture/cloud-adoption/business-strategy/cloud-migration-business-case) that include agility, flexibility, and economics. A common first step for customers to use the cloud is to start with development and test workloads.  DevTest Labs provides [features](devtest-lab-concepts.md) that benefit the enterprise and support [key enterprise dev/test scenarios](devtest-lab-guidance-get-started.md).

There is a common set of concerns when migrating these workloads to the cloud:

- [Securing development/testing resources](devtest-lab-guidance-governance-policy-compliance.md)
- [Managing and understanding cost](devtest-lab-guidance-governance-cost-ownership.md)
- Enabling self-service for developers without compromising enterprise security & compliance
- Automating and extending DevTest Labs to cover additional scenarios
- [Scaling a DevTest Labs-based solution to thousands of resources](devtest-lab-guidance-scale.md)
- [Large-scale deployments of DevTest Labs](devtest-lab-guidance-orchestrate-implementation.md)
- [Getting started with a proof of concept](devtest-lab-guidance-orchestrate-implementation.md)

## Intended audience
The Enterprise-focused documentation is intended for IT planners, architects, and managers who are responsible for establishing and reviewing overall deployments and overseeing operations practices. As a result, this document emphasizes the overall process and recommended design principles to promote a secure and stable development/testing environment, which ultimately drives adoption of Azure DevTest Labs within an organization.
