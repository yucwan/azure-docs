# Deploy models with the Azure Machine Learning service

In this document, learn how to deploy your model as a web service in the Azure cloud, or to IoT Edge devices. 

## Compute targets for deployment

Use the Azure Machine Learning SDK to deploy your trained model to the following locations:

| Compute target | Deployment type | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](#aks) | Real-time inference | Good for high-scale production deployments. Provides autoscaling, and fast response times. |
| [Azure Machine Learning Compute (amlcompute)](#azuremlcompute) | Batch inference | Run batch prediction on serverless compute. Supports normal and low-priority VMs. |
| [Azure Container Instances (ACI)](#aci) | Testing | Good for development or testing. **Not suitable for production workloads.** |
| [Azure IoT Edge](#iotedge) | (Preview) IoT module | Deploy models on IoT devices. Inferencing happens on the device. |
| [Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)](#fpga) | (Preview) Web service | Ultra-low latency for real-time inferencing. |

## Deployment workflow

The process of deploying a model is similar for all compute targets:

1. Train and register a model.
1. Configure and register an image that uses the model.
1. Deploy the image to a compute target.
1. Test the deployment

The following video demonstrates deploying to Azure Container Instances:

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE2Kwk3]


For more information on the concepts involved in the deployment workflow, see [Manage, deploy, and monitor models with Azure Machine Learning Service](concept-model-management-and-deployment.md).

## Prerequisites for deployment

[!INCLUDE [aml-prereq](../../../includes/aml-prereq.md)]

- A trained model. If you do not have a trained model, use the steps in the [Train models](tutorial-train-models-with-aml.md) tutorial to train and register one with the Azure Machine Learning service.

    > [!NOTE]
    > While the Azure Machine Learning service can work with any generic model that can be loaded in Python 3, the examples in this document demonstrate using a model stored in Python pickle format.
    >
    > For more information on using ONNX models, see the [ONNX and Azure Machine Learning](how-to-build-deploy-onnx.md) document.

## <a id="registermodel"></a> Register a trained model

The model registry is a way to store and organize your trained models in the Azure cloud. Models are registered in your Azure Machine Learning service workspace. The model can be trained using Azure Machine Learning, or another service. The following code demonstrates how to register a model from file, set a name, tags, and a description:

```python
from azureml.core.model import Model

model = Model.register(model_path = "outputs/sklearn_mnist_model.pkl",
                       model_name = "sklearn_mnist",
                       tags = {"key": "0.1"},
                       description = "test",
                       workspace = ws)
```

**Time estimate**: Approximately 10 seconds.

For an example of registering a model, see [Train an image classifier](tutorial-train-models-with-aml.md).

For more information, see the reference documentation for the [Model class](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.model.model?view=azure-ml-py).

## <a id="configureimage"></a> Create and register an image

Deployed models are packaged as an image. The image contains the dependencies needed to run the model.

For **Azure Container Instance**, **Azure Kubernetes Service**, and **Azure IoT Edge** deployments, the [azureml.core.image.ContainerImage](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.image.containerimage?view=azure-ml-py) class is used to create an image configuration. The image configuration is then used to create a new Docker image.

When creating the image configuration, you can use either a __default image__ provided by the Azure Machine Learning service or a __custom image__ that you provide.

The following code demonstrates how to create a new image configuration:

```python
from azureml.core.image import ContainerImage

# Image configuration
image_config = ContainerImage.image_configuration(execution_script = "score.py",
                                                 runtime = "python",
                                                 conda_file = "myenv.yml"}
                                                 )
```

**Time estimate**: Approximately 10 seconds.

The important parameters in this example described in the following table:

| Parameter | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `execution_script` | Specifies a Python script that is used to receive requests submitted to the service. In this example, the script is contained in the `score.py` file. For more information, see the [Execution script](#script) section. |
| `runtime` | Indicates that the image uses Python. The other option is `spark-py`, which uses Python with Apache Spark. |
| `conda_file` | Used to provide a conda environment file. This file defines the conda environment for the deployed model. For more information on creating this file, see [Create an environment file (myenv.yml)](tutorial-deploy-models-with-aml.md#create-environment-file). |

For an example of creating an image configuration, see [Deploy an image classifier](tutorial-deploy-models-with-aml.md).

For more information, see the reference documentation for [ContainerImage class](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.image.containerimage?view=azure-ml-py)

### <a id="customimage"></a> Use a custom image

When using a custom image, the image must meet the following requirements:

* Ubuntu 16.04 or greater.
* Conda 4.5.# or greater.
* Python 3.5.# or 3.6.#.

To use a custom image, set the `base_image` property of the image configuration to the address of the image. The following example demonstrates how to use an image from both a public and private Azure Container Registry:

```python
# use an image available in public Container Registry without authentication
image_config.base_image = "mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/o16n-sample-user-base/ubuntu-miniconda"

# or, use an image available in a private Container Registry
image_config.base_image = "myregistry.azurecr.io/mycustomimage:1.0"
image_config.base_image_registry.address = "myregistry.azurecr.io"
image_config.base_image_registry.username = "username"
image_config.base_image_registry.password = "password"
```

For more information on uploading images to an Azure Container Registry, see [Push your first image to a private Docker container registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-docker-cli).

If your model is trained on Azure Machine Learning Compute, using __version 1.0.22 or greater__ of the Azure Machine Learning SDK, an image is created during training. The following example demonstrates how to use this image:

```python
# Use an image built during training with SDK 1.0.22 or greater
image_config.base_image = run.properties["AzureML.DerivedImageName"]
```

### <a id="script"></a> Execution script

The execution script receives data submitted to a deployed image, and passes it to the model. It then takes the response returned by the model and returns that to the client. **The script is specific to your model**; it must understand the data that the model expects and returns. For an example script that works with an image classification model, see [Deploy an image classifier](tutorial-deploy-models-with-aml.md).

The script contains two functions that load and run the model:

* `init()`: Typically this function loads the model into a global object. This function is run only once when the Docker container is started.

* `run(input_data)`: This function uses the model to predict a value based on the input data. Inputs and outputs to the run typically use JSON for serialization and de-serialization. You can also work with raw binary data. You can transform the data before sending to the model, or before returning to the client.

#### Working with JSON data

The following example script accepts and returns JSON data. The `run` function transforms the data from JSON into a format that the model expects, and then transforms the response to JSON before returning it:

```python
%%writefile score.py
import json
import numpy as np
import os
import pickle
from sklearn.externals import joblib
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from azureml.core.model import Model

# load the model
def init():
    global model
    # retrieve the path to the model file using the model name
    model_path = Model.get_model_path('sklearn_mnist')
    model = joblib.load(model_path)

# Passes data to the model and returns the prediction
def run(raw_data):
    data = np.array(json.loads(raw_data)['data'])
    # make prediction
    y_hat = model.predict(data)
    return json.dumps(y_hat.tolist())
```

#### Working with Binary data

If your model accepts __binary data__, use `AMLRequest`, `AMLResponse`, and `rawhttp`. The following example script accepts binary data and returns the reversed bytes for POST requests. For GET requests, it returns the full URL in the response body:

```python
from azureml.contrib.services.aml_request  import AMLRequest, rawhttp
from azureml.contrib.services.aml_response import AMLResponse

def init():
    print("This is init()")

# Accept and return binary data
@rawhttp
def run(request):
    print("This is run()")
    print("Request: [{0}]".format(request))
    # handle GET requests
    if request.method == 'GET':
        respBody = str.encode(request.full_path)
        return AMLResponse(respBody, 200)
    # handle POST requests
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        reqBody = request.get_data(False)
        respBody = bytearray(reqBody)
        respBody.reverse()
        respBody = bytes(respBody)
        return AMLResponse(respBody, 200)
    else:
        return AMLResponse("bad request", 500)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `azureml.contrib` namespace changes frequently, as we work to improve the service. As such, anything in this namespace should be considered as a preview, and not fully supported by Microsoft.
>
> If you need to test this on your local development environment, you can install the components in the `contrib` namespace by using the following command:
> ```shell
> pip install azureml-contrib-services
> ```

### <a id="createimage"></a> Register the image

Once you have created the image configuration, you can use it to register an image. This image is stored in the container registry for your workspace. Once created, you can deploy the same image to multiple services.

```python
# Register the image from the image configuration
image = ContainerImage.create(name = "myimage",
                              models = [model], #this is the model object
                              image_config = image_config,
                              workspace = ws
                              )
```

**Time estimate**: Approximately 3 minutes.

Images are versioned automatically when you register multiple images with the same name. For example, the first image registered as `myimage` is assigned an ID of `myimage:1`. The next time you register an image as `myimage`, the ID of the new image is `myimage:2`.

For more information, see the reference documentation for [ContainerImage class](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.image.containerimage?view=azure-ml-py).

## <a id="deploy"></a> Deploy as a web service

When you get to deployment, the process is slightly different depending on the compute target that you deploy to. Use the information in the following sections to learn how to deploy to:

| Compute target | Deployment type | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](#aks) | Web service (Real-time inference)| Good for high-scale production deployments. Provides autoscaling, and fast response times. |
| [Azure ML Compute](#azuremlcompute) | Web service (Batch inference)| Run batch prediction on serverless compute. Supports normal and low-priority VMs. |
| [Azure Container Instances (ACI)](#aci) | Web service (Dev/test)| Good for development or testing. **Not suitable for production workloads.** |
| [Azure IoT Edge](#iotedge) | (Preview) IoT module | Deploy models on IoT devices. Inferencing happens on the device. |
| [Field-programmable gate array (FPGA)](#fpga) | (Preview) Web service | Ultra-low latency for real-time inferencing. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is not currently supported when deploying a model as a web service.

The examples in this section use [deploy_from_image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice(class)?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-from-model-workspace--name--models--image-config--deployment-config-none--deployment-target-none-), which requires you to register the model and image before doing a deployment. For more information on other deployment methods, see [deploy](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice(class)?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-workspace--name--model-paths--image-config--deployment-config-none--deployment-target-none-) and [deploy_from_model](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice(class)?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-from-model-workspace--name--models--image-config--deployment-config-none--deployment-target-none-).

### <a id="aci"></a> Deploy to Azure Container Instances (DEVTEST)

Use Azure Container Instances for deploying your models as a web service if one or more of the following conditions is true:

- You need to quickly deploy and validate your model. ACI deployment is finished in less than 5 minutes.
- You are testing a model that is under development. To see quota and region availability for ACI, see the [Quotas and region availability for Azure Container Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/container-instances-quotas) document.

To deploy to Azure Container Instances, use the following steps:

1. Define the deployment configuration. This configuration depends on the requirements of your model. The following example defines a configuration that uses one CPU core and 1 GB of memory:

    [!code-python[](~/aml-sdk-samples/ignore/doc-qa/how-to-deploy-to-aci/how-to-deploy-to-aci.py?name=configAci)]

2. To deploy the image created in the [Create the image](#createimage) section of this document, use the following code:

    [!code-python[](~/aml-sdk-samples/ignore/doc-qa/how-to-deploy-to-aci/how-to-deploy-to-aci.py?name=option3Deploy)]

    **Time estimate**: Approximately 5 minutes.

For more information, see the reference documentation for the [AciWebservice](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.aciwebservice?view=azure-ml-py) and [Webservice](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.webservice?view=azure-ml-py) classes.

### <a id="aks"></a> Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service (PRODUCTION)

To deploy your model as a high-scale production web service, use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You can use an existing AKS cluster or create a new one using the Azure Machine Learning SDK, CLI, or the Azure portal.

Creating an AKS cluster is a one time process for your workspace. You can reuse this cluster for multiple deployments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you delete the cluster, then you must create a new cluster the next time you need to deploy.

Azure Kubernetes Service provides the following capabilities:

* Autoscaling
* Logging
* Model data collection
* Fast response times for your web services
* TLS termination
* Authentication

#### Autoscaling

Autoscaling can be controlled by setting `autoscale_target_utilization`, `autoscale_min_replicas`, and `autoscale_max_replicas` for the AKS web service. The following example demonstrates how to enable autoscaling:

```python
aks_config = AksWebservice.deploy_configuration(autoscale_enabled=True,
                                                autoscale_target_utilization=30,
                                                autoscale_min_replicas=1,
                                                autoscale_max_replicas=4)
```

Decisions to scale up/down is based off of utilization of the current container replicas. The number of replicas that are busy (processing a request) divided by the total number of current replicas is the current utilization. If this number exceeds the target utilization, then more replicas are created. If it is lower, then replicas are reduced. By default, the target utilization is 70%.

Decisions to add replicas are made and implemented quickly (around 1 second). Decisions to remove replicas take longer (around 1 minute). This behavior keeps idle replicas around for a minute in case new requests arrive that they can handle.

You can calculate the required replicas by using the following code:

```python
from math import ceil
# target requests per second
targetRps = 20
# time to process the request (in seconds)
reqTime = 10
# Maximum requests per container
maxReqPerContainer = 1
# target_utilization. 70% in this example
targetUtilization = .7

concurrentRequests = targetRps * reqTime / targetUtilization

# Number of container replicas
replicas = ceil(concurrentRequests / maxReqPerContainer)
```

For more information on setting `autoscale_target_utilization`, `autoscale_max_replicas`, and `autoscale_min_replicas`, see the [AksWebservice.deploy_configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.akswebservice?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-configuration-autoscale-enabled-none--autoscale-min-replicas-none--autoscale-max-replicas-none--autoscale-refresh-seconds-none--autoscale-target-utilization-none--collect-model-data-none--auth-enabled-none--cpu-cores-none--memory-gb-none--enable-app-insights-none--scoring-timeout-ms-none--replica-max-concurrent-requests-none--max-request-wait-time-none--num-replicas-none--primary-key-none--secondary-key-none--tags-none--properties-none--description-none-) reference.

#### Create a new cluster

To create a new Azure Kubernetes Service cluster, use the following code:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating the AKS cluster is a one time process for your workspace. Once created, you can reuse this cluster for multiple deployments. If you delete the cluster or the resource group that contains it, then you must create a new cluster the next time you need to deploy.
> For [`provisioning_configuration()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.compute.akscompute?view=azure-ml-py), if you pick custom values for agent_count and vm_size, then you need to make sure agent_count multiplied by vm_size is greater than or equal to 12 virtual CPUs. For example, if you use a vm_size of "Standard_D3_v2", which has 4 virtual CPUs, then you should pick an agent_count of 3 or greater.

```python
from azureml.core.compute import AksCompute, ComputeTarget

# Use the default configuration (you can also provide parameters to customize this)
prov_config = AksCompute.provisioning_configuration()

aks_name = 'aml-aks-1'
# Create the cluster
aks_target = ComputeTarget.create(workspace = ws,
                                    name = aks_name,
                                    provisioning_configuration = prov_config)

# Wait for the create process to complete
aks_target.wait_for_completion(show_output = True)
print(aks_target.provisioning_state)
print(aks_target.provisioning_errors)
```

**Time estimate**: Approximately 20 minutes.

#### Use an existing cluster

If you already have AKS cluster in your Azure subscription, and it is version 1.12.## and has at least 12 virtual CPUs, you can use it to deploy your image. The following code demonstrates how to attach an existing AKS 1.12.## cluster to your workspace:

```python
from azureml.core.compute import AksCompute, ComputeTarget
# Set the resource group that contains the AKS cluster and the cluster name
resource_group = 'myresourcegroup'
cluster_name = 'mycluster'

# Attach the cluster to your workgroup
attach_config = AksCompute.attach_configuration(resource_group = resource_group,
                                         cluster_name = cluster_name)
aks_target = ComputeTarget.attach(ws, 'mycompute', attach_config)

# Wait for the operation to complete
aks_target.wait_for_completion(True)
```

**Time estimate**: Approximately 3 minutes.

For more information on creating an AKS cluster outside of the Azure Machine Learning SDK, see the following articles:

* [Create an AKS cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/aks?toc=%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Faks%2FTOC.json&bc=%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Fbread%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-create)
* [Create an AKS cluster (portal)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal?view=azure-cli-latest)

#### Deploy the image

To deploy the image created in the [Create the image](#createimage) section of this document to the Azure Kubernetes Server cluster, use the following code:

```python
from azureml.core.webservice import Webservice, AksWebservice

# Set configuration and service name
aks_config = AksWebservice.deploy_configuration()
aks_service_name ='aks-service-1'
# Deploy from image
service = Webservice.deploy_from_image(workspace = ws,
                                            name = aks_service_name,
                                            image = image,
                                            deployment_config = aks_config,
                                            deployment_target = aks_target)
# Wait for the deployment to complete
service.wait_for_deployment(show_output = True)
print(service.state)
```

**Time estimate**: Approximately 3 minutes.

For more information, see the reference documentation for the [AksWebservice](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.akswebservice?view=azure-ml-py) and [Webservice](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.webservice.webservice?view=azure-ml-py) classes.

### <a id="azuremlcompute"></a> Inference with Azure ML Compute

Azure ML compute targets are created and managed by the Azure Machine Learning service. They can be used for batch prediction from Azure ML Pipelines.

For a walkthrough of batch inference with Azure ML Compute, read the [How to Run Batch Predictions](how-to-run-batch-predictions.md) document.


### <a id="fpga"></a> Deploy to field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA)

Project Brainwave makes it possible to achieve ultra-low latency for real-time inferencing requests. Project Brainwave accelerates deep neural networks (DNN) deployed on field-programmable gate arrays in the Azure cloud. Commonly used DNNs are available as featurizers for transfer learning, or customizable with weights trained from your own data.

For a walkthrough of deploying a model using Project Brainwave, see the [Deploy to a FPGA](how-to-deploy-fpga-web-service.md) document.

## Define schema

Custom decorators can be used for [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification generation and input type manipulation when deploying the web service. In the `score.py` file, you provide a sample of the input and/or output in the constructor for one of the defined type objects, and the type and sample are used to automatically create the schema. The following types are currently supported:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `pyspark`
* standard Python

First ensure the necessary dependencies for the `inference-schema` package are included in your `env.yml` conda environment file. This example uses the `numpy` parameter type for the schema, so the pip extra `[numpy-support]` is also installed.

```python
%%writefile myenv.yml
name: project_environment
dependencies:
  - python=3.6.2
  - pip:
    - azureml-defaults
    - scikit-learn
    - inference-schema[numpy-support]
```

Next, modify the `score.py` file to import the `inference-schema` packages. Define the input and output sample formats in the `input_sample` and `output_sample` variables, which represent the request and response formats for the web service. Use these samples in the input and output function decorators on the `run()` function.

```python
%%writefile score.py
import json
import numpy as np
import os
import pickle
from sklearn.externals import joblib
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from azureml.core.model import Model

from inference_schema.schema_decorators import input_schema, output_schema
from inference_schema.parameter_types.numpy_parameter_type import NumpyParameterType


def init():
    global model
    model_path = Model.get_model_path('sklearn_mnist')
    model = joblib.load(model_path)


input_sample = np.array([[1.8]])
output_sample = np.array([43638.88])

@input_schema('data', NumpyParameterType(input_sample))
@output_schema(NumpyParameterType(output_sample))
def run(raw_data):
    data = np.array(json.loads(raw_data)['data'])
    y_hat = model.predict(data)
    return json.dumps(y_hat.tolist())
```

After following the normal image registration and web service deployment process with the updated `score.py` file, retrieve the Swagger uri from the service. Requesting this uri will return the `swagger.json` file.

```python
service.wait_for_deployment(show_output=True)
print(service.swagger_uri)
```



When you create a new image, you must manually update each service that you want to use the new image. To update the web service, use the `update` method. The following code demonstrates how to update the web service to use a new image:

```python
from azureml.core.webservice import Webservice
from azureml.core.image import Image

service_name = 'aci-mnist-3'
# Retrieve existing service
service = Webservice(name = service_name, workspace = ws)

# point to a different image
new_image = Image(workspace = ws, id="myimage2:1")

# Update the image used by the service
service.update(image = new_image)
print(service.state)
```

For more information, see the reference documentation for the [Webservice](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice(class)?view=azure-ml-py) class.

## Test web service deployments

To test a web service deployment, you can use the `run` method of the Webservice object. In the following example, a JSON document is set to a web service and the result is displayed. The data sent must match what the model expects. In this example, the data format matches the input expected by the diabetes model.

```python
import json

test_sample = json.dumps({'data': [
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],
    [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
]})
test_sample = bytes(test_sample,encoding = 'utf8')

prediction = service.run(input_data = test_sample)
print(prediction)
```

The webservice is a REST API, so you can create client applications in a variety of programming languages. For more information, see [Create client applications to consume webservices](how-to-consume-web-service.md).

## <a id="update"></a> Update the web service

When you create a new image, you must manually update each service that you want to use the new image. To update the web service, use the `update` method. The following code demonstrates how to update the web service to use a new image:

```python
from azureml.core.webservice import Webservice

## <a id="iotedge"></a> Deploy to Azure IoT Edge

An Azure IoT Edge device is a Linux or Windows-based device that runs the Azure IoT Edge runtime. Using the Azure IoT Hub, you can deploy machine learning models to these devices as IoT Edge modules. Deploying a model to an IoT Edge device allows the device to use the model directly, instead of having to send data to the cloud for processing. You get faster response times and less data transfer.

Azure IoT Edge modules are deployed to your device from a container registry. When you create an image from your model, it is stored in the container registry for your workspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this section assumes that you are already familiar with Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Edge modules. While some of the information in this section is specific to Azure Machine Learning service, the majority of the process to deploy to an edge device happens in the Azure IoT service.
>
> If you are unfamiliar with Azure IoT, see [Azure IoT Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-fundamentals/) and [Azure IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/) for basic information. Then use the other links in this section to learn more about specific operations.

### Set up your environment

* A development environment. For more information, see the [How to configure a development environment](how-to-configure-environment.md) document.

* An [Azure IoT Hub](../../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) in your Azure subscription.

* A trained model. For an example of how to train a model, see the [Train an image classification model with Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-train-models-with-aml.md) document. A pre-trained model is available on the [AI Toolkit for Azure IoT Edge GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/ai-toolkit-iot-edge/tree/master/IoT%20Edge%20anomaly%20detection%20tutorial).

### <a id="getcontainer"></a> Get the container registry credentials

To deploy an IoT Edge module to your device, Azure IoT needs the credentials for the container registry that Azure Machine Learning service stores docker images in.

You can get the credentials in two ways:

+ **In the Azure portal**:

  1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/signin/index).

  1. Go to your Azure Machine Learning service workspace and select __Overview__. To go to the container registry settings, select the __Registry__ link.

  1. Once in the container registry, select **Access Keys** and then enable the admin user.

     ![An image of the access keys screen](./media/how-to-deploy-and-where/findaccesskey.png)

  1. Save the values for **login server**, **username**, and **password**.

+ **With a Python script**:

  1. Use the following Python script after the code you ran above to create a container:

     ```python
     # Getting your container details
     container_reg = ws.get_details()["containerRegistry"]
     reg_name=container_reg.split("/")[-1]
     container_url = "\"" + image.image_location + "\","
     subscription_id = ws.subscription_id
     from azure.mgmt.containerregistry import ContainerRegistryManagementClient
     from azure.mgmt import containerregistry
     client = ContainerRegistryManagementClient(ws._auth,subscription_id)
     result= client.registries.list_credentials(resource_group_name, reg_name, custom_headers=None, raw=False)
     username = result.username
     password = result.passwords[0].value
     print('ContainerURL{}'.format(image.image_location))
     print('Servername: {}'.format(reg_name))
     print('Username: {}'.format(username))
     print('Password: {}'.format(password))
     ```
  1. Save the values for ContainerURL, servername, username, and password.

     These credentials are necessary to provide the IoT Edge device access to images in your private container registry.

### Prepare the IoT device

Register your device with Azure IoT Hub, and then install the IoT Edge runtime on the device. If you are not familiar with this process, see [Quickstart: Deploy your first IoT Edge module to a Linux x64 device](../../iot-edge/quickstart-linux.md).

Other methods of registering a device are:

* [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-register-device-portal)
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-register-device-cli)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-register-device-vscode)

### Deploy the model to the device

To deploy the model to the device, use the registry information gathered in the [Get container registry credentials](#getcontainer) section with the module deployment steps for IoT Edge modules. For example, when [Deploying Azure IoT Edge modules from the Azure portal](../../iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-portal.md), you must configure the __Registry settings__ for the device. Use the __login server__, __username__, and __password__ for your workspace container registry.

You can also deploy using [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-cli) and [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-deploy-modules-vscode).

## Clean up

To delete a deployed web service, use `service.delete()`.

To delete an image, use `image.delete()`.

To delete a registered model, use `model.delete()`.

For more information, see the reference documentation for [WebService.delete()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice(class)?view=azure-ml-py#delete--), [Image.delete()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.image.image(class)?view=azure-ml-py#delete--), and [Model.delete()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.model.model?view=azure-ml-py#delete--).
