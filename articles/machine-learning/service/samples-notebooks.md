# Use Jupyter notebooks to explore Azure Machine Learning service

For your convenience, we have developed a series of Jupyter Python notebooks you can use to explore the Azure Machine Learning service. 

Learn how to use the service with the documentation on this site and use these notebooks to customize them to your situation. 

Use one of the paths below to run a notebook server with these sample notebooks.  Once the server is running, find tutorial notebooks in **tutorials** folder, or explore different features in **how-to-use-azureml** folder.


## Try Azure Notebooks: Free Jupyter notebooks in the cloud

It's easy to get started with Azure Notebooks! The [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://aka.ms/aml-sdk) is already installed and configured for you on [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/). The installation and future updates are automatically managed via Azure services.
  
[!INCLUDE [aml-azure-notebooks](../../../includes/aml-azure-notebooks.md)]


## Use a Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)

The [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://aka.ms/aml-sdk) and notebook server are already installed and configured for you on a DSVM. 

After you [create a DSVM](how-to-configure-environment.md#dsvm), use these steps on the DSVM to run the notebooks.

[!INCLUDE [aml-dsvm-server](../../../includes/aml-dsvm-server.md)]


## Use your own Jupyter notebook server

Use these steps to create a local Jupyter Notebook server on your computer.

[!INCLUDE [aml-your-server](../../../includes/aml-your-server.md)]

The quickstart instructions will install the packages you need to run the quickstart and tutorial notebooks.  Other sample notebooks may require installation of additional components.  For more information about these components, see [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install).
